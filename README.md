# FeedHenry Oracle Connection Tester - Cloud side

Uses the node [Oracle Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/oracle) to connect and return the date form an instance of Oracle.  Tested using an Amazon RDS Oracle instance.

Works in partnership with the [Oracle Connect Client](https://github.com/FeedHenrySuprt/Oracle-Connect-Client)


Note that, for this to work, [Oracle InstantClient](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/instant-client/index-097480.html) has to be installed on the dyno.
